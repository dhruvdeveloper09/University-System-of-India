        <h1>IIT System</h1>
        <p>Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are a network of 23 autonomous engineering institutions in India that
            offer undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in various engineering disciplines. The IITs are
            renowned for their high academic standards, rigorous curriculum, and cutting-edge research. They have
            produced some of the most talented engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs in India and have made
            significant contributions to the country's technological advancement.
            <br>
            The first Indian Institute of Technology was founded in May 1950 at the site of the Hijli Detention Camp in
            Kharagpur, West Bengal. The name "Indian Institute of Technology" was adopted before the formal inauguration
            of the institute on 18 August 1951 by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.
            <br>
            On 15 September 1956, the Parliament of India passed the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act,
            declaring it as an Institute of National Importance.
